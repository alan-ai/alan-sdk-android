## The Intelligent App Platform

Alan AI is transforming enterprise software with a new approach, **Application-Level AI**. Instead of relying on manual development or isolated AI tools, we embed an intelligent layer into your application that builds features on demand.

Powered by our proprietary **Three-Layer AI (3LAI)** architecture, our system generates both business logic and UI in real time—no developers needed. It works across your entire app stack: the user interface, business logic, and data management.

The **Intelligent App Platform** lets companies integrate AI-driven interfaces into their existing apps in days, not months.

It creates a safe and validated environment from your app’s APIs, GUIs, and documentation, enabling accurate, context-aware code generation. At runtime, the AI acts like a self-coding engine—instantly creating new features based on user needs.

With Alan AI, your software becomes truly adaptive—responding, evolving, and scaling automatically.

This repository contains the **Alan AI SDK for Android**, enabling you to embed Alan's intelligent layer into your Android applications.

## How to start

To create an AI agent for your Android app written in Java or Kotlin:

1. <a href="https://studio.alan.app/register" target="_blank">Sign up for Alan AI Studio</a> to build dialog scripts in JavaScript and test them.
2. Use the Alan AI SDK for Android to embed an AI agent to your app. For details, see <a href="https://alan.app/docs/client-api/android/android-api" target="_blank">Alan AI documentation</a>.
